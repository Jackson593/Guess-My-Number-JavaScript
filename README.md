You will need to have all of the files downloaded into the same directory in order to run the script. In order to run the script you will open the index.html file which will run in your default web browser. 

The point of the game is to guess the hidden number. Once you input a number into the text field you will click the 'Check!' button, if you are correct you will gain one point. If you are incorrect you will loose a point. Once you win you will have the option to continue with the 'Again' button. You start off with 20 points, and if you hit 0 you loose. Can you beat 20?
